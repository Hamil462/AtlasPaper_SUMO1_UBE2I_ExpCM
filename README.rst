Phylogenetic analyses for Mis-sense Atlas
==========================================

This repository contains analyses relevant to the Atlas of Functional Missense Variation paper by the the lab of Fritz Roth.

Phylogenetic analysis with experimentally informed codon models using deep mutational scanning data for SUMO1 and UBE2I.

The analysis and all results are in the iPython notebook ``SUMO_and_UBE2I_analysis.ipynb``. Open by installing ``jupyter`` and running::

    jupyter notebook SUMO_and_UBE2I_analysis.ipynb
